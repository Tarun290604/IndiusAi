# Indius AI  

**Indius AI** is an **AI-powered Data Science & Analytics platform** designed to transform **raw data into intelligent insights.** Unlike traditional AI tools, it is built specifically for **non-coders** and individuals outside the data science domain. The platform can analyze datasets, summarize key insights, perform **advanced hypothesis testing (e.g., Chi-Square tests),** and generate **visualizations**—all without requiring repeated user prompts.  

Indius AI leverages **SmolAgent**, a powerful agent-based framework, to automate complex data analysis workflows. **SmolAgent allows the platform to perform multi-step tasks autonomously without requiring constant human intervention**—a feature that distinguishes it from conventional LLM-based tools.
