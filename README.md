# Indius AI  

**Indius AI** is an **AI-powered Data Science & Analytics platform** designed to transform **raw data into intelligent insights.** Unlike traditional AI tools, it is built specifically for **non-coders** and individuals outside the data science domain. The platform can analyze datasets, summarize key insights, perform **advanced hypothesis testing (e.g., Chi-Square tests),** and generate **visualizations**—all without requiring repeated user prompts.  

Indius AI leverages **SmolAgent**, a powerful agent-based framework, to automate complex data analysis workflows. **SmolAgent allows the platform to perform multi-step tasks autonomously without requiring constant human intervention**—a feature that distinguishes it from conventional LLM-based tools.

## 🚀 Key Features  

### 📝 Data Summary & Quality Check  
Provides a quick overview of dataset properties, ensuring data integrity before analysis.
Examples include:  
✔ **Basic Overview**: Number of rows, columns, data types, and memory usage.  
✔ **Missing Values**: Identifies and reports missing values in the dataset.  
✔ **Duplicate Entries**: Detects and highlights duplicate records.  

### 📊 Data Visualization & Analysis  
Generates meaningful visual representations of data trends and distributions. 
Examples include:  
✔ **Histograms** for distribution analysis.  
✔ **Box plots** for outlier detection.  
✔ **Scatter plots** for correlation analysis.  
✔ **Bar and Pie charts** for categorical data insights.  

### 🔎 AI-Powered Prompting for Data Understanding  
Allows users to interact with the dataset by asking questions.
Examples include:  
✔ *"What are the key trends in this dataset?"*  
✔ *"Which column has the highest variance?"*  
✔ *"Can you summarize the correlation between variables?"*  

### 📊 Advanced Hypothesis Testing  
Performs statistical tests to validate assumptions about the dataset. Examples include:  
✔ **Chi-Square Test** for categorical relationships.  
✔ **t-Test** for comparing group means.  
✔ **ANOVA** for multi-group comparisons.  
✔ **Correlation tests (Pearson/Spearman/Kendall).**  

### 📂 Seamless File Upload & Processing  
Allows users to upload their datasets effortlessly.
Examples include:  
✔ **CSV and Excel file uploads** for instant analysis.
